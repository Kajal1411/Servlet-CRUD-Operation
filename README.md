# Servlet-CRUD-Operation

# Servlet CRUD Operation Project 

This is a basic Java Servlet-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project that demonstrates how to build a simple dynamic web application using core Java EE technologies. It uses **HTML** forms for user input, **Java Servlets** for backend logic, and **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** to interact with a **Oracle database**. Each operation (insert, display, update, delete, and search) is handled through dedicated HTML forms and corresponding Java Servlet classes.

The project follows a straightforward structure with minimal complexity, making it ideal for **beginners** who want to understand:

- How form data is sent to the server using GET/POST methods
- How Servlets process requests and responses
- How to connect to a database and execute SQL queries using JDBC
- How to perform common data operations (CRUD) in a real-world setup

It can serve as a foundation for more advanced Java web applications such as student record systems, employee management systems, or event tracking platforms.
